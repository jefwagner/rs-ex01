# RocketsAsSpaceships

What is a rocket? Dictionaries define a rocket as a vehicle - a spacecraft, aircraft, boat, car - powered by a rocket engine[1]. However, even if a 'rocket' can be any type of vehicles, the term rocket almost universally brings to mind spacecraft. This is because rocket engines are unique in that they allow movement in space. In this video we will examine how rocket engines generate thrust in space. And along our way, we will define specific impulse, which will allow us to quantify the efficiency for a rocket engine, and finally we will find a quantitative expression for thrust.

[1] Now, there is some question of whether to use rocket 'engine' or rocket 'motor'. Both terms are acceptable since an engine is a type of motor. However long standing use in rocketry - rockets that use solid fuel are called to as rocket motors, while rockets that use liquid fuel and moving parts such as pumps or turbines are rocket engines.

Early we said that rockets allow movement in space, but what do we mean by movement? Let's start with Newton's first law of motion: an object at rest stays at rest. It doesn't matter how much our astro-cat flails around, she cannot start moving without an external force. The other half of Newton's first law: an object moving at constant speed in a straight line continues to move along that line unless acted upon by another external force. After we have given our astro-cat a push, she can't stop and will drift off forever unless we give her another push in to stop her. So our astrocat is stuck in space without an external force that can push her. 

Let's revisit the quesiton we were trying to ask. What do we mean by movement? For rockets it means the rocket engine can create thrust that acts as an external force. It can cause the rocket to start moving from rest, and it can bring a moving rocket to rest. But how does a rocket engine generate thrust in space, especially in the case where it is all alone? What supplies the external force?

That quesiton applys to more than just rockets. How do other vehicles, like boats or cars, move? Where do they get their external force. For all vehicles besides rockets, they use Newton's third law and push against something in the surrounding environment. Let take as an example a cat in a rowboat initially at rest? The cat in the rowboat uses the oars to push against the water, then according to Newton's third law the water will push against cat in the rowboat with equal force in the opposite direction. That external force from the water onto the boat causes it to start to move from rest. The same principle works for other vehicles. The tires in a car push against the ground, and the ground pushes back causing the car to move from rest. The propeller or an airplane pushes against the surrounding air, and the air pushes against the airplane causing it start moving down the runway. But our poor astro-cat is floating in space and has nothing to push against!

# ThirdLawInSpace

There is no getting around physical laws. If there is nothing around to push against then the astro-cat will have to bring the material to push against with it. Lets give the astro-cat has a ball. Lets examine this situation in detail to learn what we can about the motion of the cat and ball. Initially, the astro-cat and ball are at rest. Then the cat pushes against the ball, which we will label F sub bee. According to Newton's third law, the ball pushes back against the cat that we will label F sub see and we know that F sub bee and F sub see are the same size.

However, our cat has short little limbs, and can't push against the ball for that long before the ball goes out of reach.
